dot-files
=========
This repository includes mostly various *rc and conf files of my linux/dwm
set up. Just clone this repo and run 

    $ cd dot-files
    $ stow bash
    $ stow vim

to install, for example, the bashrcs and .vim files into your home directory.

For more on how to handle your dot files with [GNU
stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) see this nice
[article](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).
